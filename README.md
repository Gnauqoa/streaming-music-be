## Setup

To set up the Streaming Music Backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using Bundler. Run `bundle install` to install all required gems.

3. **Database Setup:** Set up the database required for the backend system. This may involve creating a new database instance, running migrations, and seeding initial data. You can use tools like ActiveRecord migrations and seeds to manage the database schema and data.

4. **Environment Configuration:** Configure environment variables required for the backend. These variables may include database connection settings, API keys, and security parameters. You can use a tool like dotenv to manage environment variables.

5. **Start the Server:** Once everything is set up, start the server using the appropriate command. For example, if you're using Rack or Sinatra, run `rackup` or `ruby app.rb` respectively.

## Configuration

The backend system can be configured using environment variables. Here are the key environment variables you may need to set:

- `DATABASE_URL`: The connection URL for the database.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for encrypting user authentication tokens.
- `API_KEY`: API key required for accessing third-party services (if applicable).
- `PORT`: The port on which the server should listen for incoming requests.

Make sure to set these variables according to your environment before starting the server.

## Usage

Once the backend server is up and running, you can interact with it using the provided APIs. The API documentation can be found [here](localhost:3000/user-api-docs).

You can use tools like Postman or curl to make API requests and test the functionalities provided by the backend system.
